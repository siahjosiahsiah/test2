<p>
Transmitters and receivers are vital components in communication systems, facilitating the exchange of information over various media. A transmitter converts data, such as audio or video signals, into electromagnetic waves suitable for transmission, often involving modulation to adapt the signal for the medium, as seen in radio broadcasting.

On the other hand, receivers are responsible for capturing and interpreting the transmitted signals, extracting the original information, and presenting it in a usable form. They employ demodulation techniques to recover the original data from the carrier signal, ensuring accurate reception.

In modern technology, transmitters and receivers play a pivotal role in wireless communication, like cell phones and Wi-Fi networks, enabling seamless data transmission and reception. Whether in broadcasting, telecommunications, or everyday gadgets, these components are the foundation of effective communication systems.
